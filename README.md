As a name and lookup service built on the Polygon blockchain, EDNS provides a Decentralized Domain Naming Service for Web3.0-related demands, including NFT, Cryptocurrency Wallet, Web hosting, DeFi ID, and GameFi ID in the Digital world, by translating machine-readable addresses to human-readable addresses.

EDNS Domains aims at being the pioneer of Web 3.0 disruption by supporting users with innovative Web 3.0 products.  Endeavouring to serve a wider range of users, EDNS will expand to support more blockchains, and ultimately become a multi-chain platform. Thus, we cordially invite different blockchain projects to join the EDNS ecosystem and grow together in this Web 3.0 journey.

To start with, our EDNS Eco-members are encouraged to integrate the EDNS Software Development Kit (SDK) with your dApp products to create a seamless user experience.

Unlike traditional domains in the Web 2.0 world, decentralized domains can integrate dApps from various chains and be more secure. Furthermore, by linking wallets, decentralized domains can simplify platform operations and data management for projects by optimising the user login step, which also greatly enhance the user experience. Accelerating blockchain projectsâ€™ entry into Web 3.0, our easy-to-integrate SDK can work well with different types of dApps, for example, wallets, NFT platforms, GameFi games and more.
